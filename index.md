<img class="profile-picture" src="personal picture.jpg">

Hi! My name is Ahmed Atya. I am a Senior year student in Bachelor's of Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence at Kafr El-Sheikh University, Egypt.

## Research Interest

At the moment, I am interested in Deep Reinforcement Learning, Meta Learning, Multi-Agent Systems,  and Information retrieval.

## Current Status

I have worked as an R&D engineer at [SpeedLegal](https://speedlegal.io/), a legal tech startup based in US California, where I contributed to solving multiple legal problems related to contract review automation using retrieval augmented generation pipelines. At the moment, I'm searching for internships that involve solving exciting reinforcement learning problems ! As well as preparing for my graduate studies in the field of AI.
