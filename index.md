## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="personal picture.jpg">

Hi! My name is Ahmed Atya. I am a Senior year student student of Bachelor's Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence at Kafr El-Sheikh University, Egypt. 

## Research Interest

At the moment, I am interested in the applications of Deep learning in Reinforcement Learning and Information retrieval, especially these topics: 
- Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Information Retrieval
- Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
- Imitation learning 
- Meta Learning

## Current Status

I have worked as an R&D engineer at [SpeedLegal](https://speedlegal.io/), a legal tech startup based in US California, where I contributed to solving multiple legal problems related to contract review automation using retrieval augmented generation pipelines. At the moment, I'm searching for internships that involve solving exciting reinforcement learning problems !
